# About Us

Hello! We are a multidisciplinary group of undergraduate students from the
University of California, San Diego. Though every member from our team came from a
very different background, we all share one trait together: our deep
passion and drive to not only learn, but also advance the field of autonomous
systems. Let's meet the team!

### Software Team

There were four members on the software team whom each had distinct
responsibilities. However, due to the small size of our team, these
responsibilities oftentimes overlapped, so we will group the
software tasks together. The software team was in charge of three primary tasks:
(1) sensor interpretation, (2) spatial mapping and localization (SLAM), and
(3) autonomous navigation algorithm. The four members are listed below.
